REACT (frontend/UI):
- react uses jsx, which allows html to be written as part of a javascript script
    - ive seen html being returned so far usually
    - allows JS logic in html

    HTML:
        -div tag (<div ____> </div>)
            -a div element takes up full available with, and starts on a new line
            -easy to group related things/keep things on same level of DOM
            -flexible container
            -import a matching css file for ez styling


    COMPONENTS:
        -export default components 
        -

    ROUTING/LINKING:
        -import {} from 'react-router-dom'
        -this allows urls to be used as part of app
            -can create links that have returns, etc
        -wrap return statement of App.js in <Router>
        -wrap individual Route(s) with <Routes>
        -<Route path="PATHNAME" element = {<COMPONENT />}
